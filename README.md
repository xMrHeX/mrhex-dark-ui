# MrHeX Dark UI theme

A dark UI theme for Atom.

I like dark windows and lots of bright colored text that pops out at you.
Best with [MrHeX Dark Syntax](https://github.com/xMrHeX/mrhex-dark-syntax)

I started with [one-dark-ui](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui) as a template and went from there.
Bracket matcher snippet is from [Sarim](https://discuss.atom.io/users/sarim) Thanks!

This theme can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
